        <p> *** Thank you for visiting my Crystal Collector Game Page! In case this 
            game has gotten you interested in crystal hunting IRL here are a few things to consider
            before you begin your adventure: ***
        </p>
            <ul>Packing Right!</ul>
            <li>A Good Shovel - I have seen people using full size shovels but in my experience you can't beat a good study Mini Shovel. Trust me its worth the investment. Mining for crystals can involve tight spaces and steep hills.</table></li>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <li>A Bucket - A bucket, a backpack - whatever seems easiest and allows you
                to most easily manouver around possibly rough terrain. 
                You can get super creative with this guys! - I like the backpack route. 
                I try to consolidate my equipment so I have free hands as often as I can. Carrying a shovel a backpack with water and some snacks
                AND a bucket can be a little much. BUT whatever floats your boat. If you're going to go with the backpack I recommend
                lining it with a garbage can liner so you can easily have your crystals consolidated
                when you go to empty it out at the end of the day. </li>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <li>A Classifier Screen - A classifier screen can make a huge difference especially during (or after) a rainy day. Dirt can easily disguise crystals and screening out the dirt will make the hours you spend on your adventure way more effecient.</li>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <li>A Head Lamp - Not totally necessary - but why not. If your just getting into crystal hunting
                you may not immediately delve into 10ft holes in the mountain side to go digging. However, for safety precautions - 
            like staying on the mountain for longer than anticipated, its better to be save than sorry if it gets dark out. </li>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <li>Gloves - And I mean the kind you get dirty. While gloves are not a necessity it can sometimes 
                be uncomfrotable to have chunks of dirt underneath your nail beds. Gloves can also prevent
                cuts and scrapes - but now that I mention that bring some bandades and maybe a first aid kit too! </li>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <li>WATER WATER WATER! - I have gone on crystal excursions before where I've anticipated my journey
                being a couple hours at max. I pack a nalgene full of water and think that is enough but trust 
                me when I say crystal hunting is addicting! Two hours turns into four when you begin finding 
                various shapes and sizes of crystals in various spots and altitudes on the mountain. </li>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <li>Layers & Snacks - Like the comfort of a warm latte and fuzzy socks on a chilly day, an insulated
                jacket (or in the summer at least a rain jacket) and some GORP (Good Old Raisins and Peanuts) will
                relax, energize and rejuvinate all at the same time! FUEL YOURSELF!</li>
            
            <ul>Attitude</ul>
            <li>Respect - These little (and big) crystals, rocks etc are very sacred and should be
                treated as such.</li>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <li>Breathe - If something happens whether its an injury or a loss of direction in the area you're 
                adventuring in, it is important to keep your cool and keep oxygen flowing to your brain. Taking a deep breath
                in and out a few times - s  l   o   w   l   y - is essential to your mind, body connection and allows
                for a clear mind to make the right safe and careful decisions in these situations.  
             </li>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <li>Lighten up! - Crystal hunting adventures are supposed to be a lighthearted, 
                beautiful experience. Dont get discouraged if you dont find many - your just getting started
                and it takes some time for you to develop a keen eye for spotting them out. HAVE FUN!
            </li>
